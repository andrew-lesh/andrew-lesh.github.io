Albert I,USA,Blossom No. 2,21 March 1949,Rhesus Macaque,"The Blossom series of missions launched the first animals into space aboard V-2 rockets as part of the broader Hermes program to adopt this vehicle (and weapon) acquired from the defeated Nazi Germany.  Blossom No. 2 featured the first mammal to fly aboard an American rocket, a rhesus macaque named Albert I (Blossom No. 1 contained fruit flies and successfully recovered them).  The rocket reached an apogee of 62 km after a premature burnout and a failure in the parachute bulkhead caused Albert I's capsule to impact the ground with lethal force.","Albert I, a 9 pound rhesus macaque, was anesthetized by Dr. James Henry with between 10 and 15 mg of sodium pentobarbital 45 minutes before launch and punctured with electrode needles of an electrocardiogram.  Army Air Corps Major David Simons decided anesthesia was necessary to prevent him experiencing discomfort in the cramped capsule (and possible pain in case the capsule had a rough landing).  2 cc's of luminal, a long-acting barbituate, were also administered immediately before the flight as a further safeguard.  Major Simons noted that the capsule, essentially a metal tube, was so tight that 'his head had to be placed in a cramped, forward position with his neck acutely flexed'.||After sealing the capsule, researchers were unable to get a cardiac or respiratory reading and were unsure whether Albert I had died of suffocation or the measuring equipment was faulty.  Nonetheless, the launch proceeded and the capsule's parachute failed.  A flight recorder showed no evidence of physiological activity during the flight, so it was determined that Albert I was likely smothered by his tight capsule before launch (likely further complicated by overheating).  Even if he had survived his cramped conditions, however, the parachute failure would have guaranteed his death regardless.",1,monkey,y,,,,
Albert II,USA,Blossom No. 4,14 June 1949,Rhesus Macaque,"Blossom No. 4 was the second V-2 flight to carry a mammal, another rhesus macaque named Albert II.  The rocket performed well, reaching an apogee of 133 km and making Albert II the first mammal to cross the Karman Line at 100 km and enter outer space.  Unfortunately, the recovery parachute failed and Albert II was killed on impact with the ground.","Albert II, a 6 pound rhesus monkey, was chosen because it was thought his smaller size than Albert I would give him a higher likelihood of avoiding being smothered in his tight capsule (which was itself made 1 inch wider than Albert I's capsule at 13 inches vs 12 inches, respectively).  Albert II was anesthetized before launch similar to Albert I and improved instrumentation meant that his cardiac and respiratory activity could be verified.  The capsule was surrounded with dry ice to keep it cool and prevent him from overheating, which was thought to contribute to Albert I's death.||Albert II's vitals were successfully recorded throughout the flight and showed no change in microgravity.  Unfortunately, a parachute failure resulted in the capsule impacting the ground hard enough to create a 5 foot deep, 10 foot diameter crater, killing him instantly. ",1,monkey,y,,,,
Unnamed Mouse,USA,Blossom No. 7,31 August 1950,Mouse,"The fifth and flight of an animal aboard an American V-2 rocket.  The rocket had a nominal flight, making it to an apogee of 136 km, but its recovery parachute failed and the mouse was killed on impact.","The mouse that flew aboard Blossom No. 7 was held in a transparent plexiglass container.  The floor of the container was made of a metal wire screen to give them something to grip onto.  They weren't restrained or anesthetized so that their reaction to the rocket's acceleration and microgravity could be filmed with a camera designed at the Wright Air Development Center's Technical Photographic Laboratory.  The resulting video recording showed the mouse relatively unbothered by the flight.  In microgravity, the mouse showed no preference for any particular orientation.||Like their unfortunate forerunners, the mouse was killed after their recovery parachute failed and they impacted the ground.",1,mouse,y,,,,
Laika,USSR,Sputnik 2,3 November 1957,Dog,"Sputnik 2 ( Russian: Спутник-2, Satellite 2) was the second spacecraft to orbit the Earth and carried the first animal into orbit, a dog named Laika.  The spacecraft lacked a recovery system, leaving Laika no means to return home.  The mission designers decided that monitoring the vitals of a mammal in orbit was worth the animal's guaranteed death.  She died only hours into the flight after the capsule's thermal control system failed.  ","Laika (Russian: Лайка, meaning 'barker') was a stray dog taken from the streets of Moscow and trained to reside in the interior of Sputnik 2, becoming the first animal to orbit the Earth.  At the time of her famous mission she was thought to be about 3 years old and weighed only 5 kg.||The Soviet space program rushed to determine the health effects of orbit to determine if they could place a human in space before the United States.  As part of this rush, Sputnik 2 contained no recovery system.  While many animals had already died in spaceflight accidents up to this point, Laika was the first animal to be sealed in a spacecraft with no chance of survival.  The plan was to have her eat poisoned food before she ran out of oxygen, but the capsule's temperature control system cut the intended medical monitoring short.  Alone, afraid, and panting frantically, Laika died of hyperthermia only hours into the flight, on the spacecraft's fourth orbit.  ||Prior to her launch, program physician Vladimir Yazdovsky took Laika to his home so she could play with his children.  He said 'Laika was quiet and charming... I wanted to do something nice for her.  She had so little time left to live.'||In 1998, the Soviet air force officer that trained Laika for her doomed mission, Oleg Gazenko, said this:  ||'Work with animals is a source of suffering to all of us. We treat them like babies who cannot speak. The more time passes, the more I’m sorry about it. We shouldn’t have done it. We did not learn enough from the mission to justify the death of the dog.'",1,dog,y,,,,
Albert III,USA,Blossom No. 5,16 September 1949,Rhesus Macaque,"The third flight of an animal aboard an American V-2 rocket.  25 seconds into the flight, the tail of the rocket exploded and after another 14 seconds  there was a second explosion that destroyed the rest of the rocket and killed Albert III, a Rhesus Macaque monkey, at an altitude of 4 km.","After Albert III's V-2 rocket exploded, a post-flight investigation found that there had been a large hole in its fuel system that had gone unnoticed prior to launch.  Unfortunately, even if this issue had been caught and resolved, it seems unlikely that he would have survived the recovery attempt.  Every other flight of a monkey aboard a V-2 ended in a parachute failure.",1,monkey,y,,,,
Albert IV,USA,Blossom No. 6,8 December 1949,Crab-eating Macaque,"The fourth flight of a monkey aboard an American V-2 rocket.  The vehicle performed nominally and attained an apogee of 130 km, but the recovery parachute failed.  Its occupant, a crab-eating macaque named Albert IV, died upon impacting the ground.","Like Albert I and Albert II, Albert IV was killed when his recovery parachute failed and he impacted the ground.  His vitals were successfully transmitted prior to his death and they showed no significant disturbance in response to the rocket's acceleration or his brief experience of microgravity, building the Air Force's confidence that a human could survive spaceflight.||Albert IV was a crab-eating macaque unlike the Alberts who preceded him who were all rhesus macaques.",1,monkey,y,,,,
Yorick,USA,Aerobee-19,20 September 1951,Rhesus Macaque,"The second and final flight of animals aboard an Aerobee rocket, containing Yorick the Rhesus Macaque and 11 mice.  The flight itself, dubbed the 'Arkful of Animals', was a success, reaching an apogee of 72 km, and exposing its occupants to microgravity.  Unfortunately, even though the capsule safely parachuted back to the ground, recovery was too slow to save Yorick and two of the mice.  They died from hyperthermia from the capsule baking in the desert sun.","Yorick the rhesus macaque, also called Albert VI, quickly fell ill with heat sickness after his capsule landed as it baked in the sun due to the recovery team being delayed.  Despite the efforts of medical personnel, he died in a Medical Corps station wagon en route to the air force base's hospital from a combination of hyperthermia and shock only two hours after landing.",3,monkey,y,,,,
two unnamed mice,USA,Aerobee-19,20 September 1951,Mouse,"The second and final flight of animals aboard an Aerobee rocket, containing Yorick the Rhesus Macaque and 11 mice.  While the flight itself was a success and the capsule safely parachuted back to the ground, recovery was too slow to save Yorick and two of the mice, who died from hyperthermia as the capsule baked in the desert sun.","Of the 11 mice flying aboard Aerobee-19, 9 were held in a chamber to evaluate their exposure to cosmic rays in the upper atmosphere.  The remaining two were placed in a divided plexiglass drum and filmed to see their reactions to microgravity.  Prior to launch, one of those two mice had the labyrinths of their inner ears intentionally damaged in order to disable their vestibular sense.||Two of these 11 mice died from hyperthermia in the capsule after landing as it baked in the sun.  The mouse with the damaged inner ear is known to have survived.  The specific identities of the martyred mice are unknown.",3,mouse,y,,,,
Albert V,USA,Aerobee-12,18 April 1951,Capuchin Monkey,"The Aerobee rocket was developed to be less expensive than the V-2, the supply of which was rapidly dwindling, and could reach an apogee of 230 km without a payload.  Aerobee-12 was the first flight of a space-capable rocket of original American design to carry an animal, Albert V, a capuchin monkey, and several mice.  This flight from Holloman Air Force Base reached an apogee of 58 km, over halfway to space, before Albert V's capsule suffered yet another parachute failure, killing him and the mice on impact with the ground.","Albert V, a capuchin monkey, was placed in a small capsule fitted into the nosecone of the Aerobee rocket.  After launch, elemetry from the rocket showed that he survived the acceleration and didn't seem harmed by his brief exposure to microgravity around the rocket's apogee.  During descent, his capsule's parachute failed and crashed in the desert near Holloman Air Force Base.  The capsule was never found despite an extensive search and he was presumed dead from the impact.",2,monkey,y,,,,

Gordo,USA,Bioflight 1 (Jupiter AM-13),13 December 1958,Squirrel Monkey,"The first flight of an animal aboard the Jupiter IRBM (Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile).  The rocket took off from Cape Canaveral Launch Complex 26, carrying a squirrel monkey named Gordo, and reached an apogee of 467 km.  The capsule successfully re-entered but was lost at sea.","Gordo, a squirrel monkey, was originally named Old Reliable because of he was a fast learner and excelled at his training.  He was renamed to Gordo prior to launch, a name that could be better understood over noisy radio comms.  He was restrained onto a miniature silicone couch and wore a leather-lined plastic helmet for the duration of his mission.  He was in a seated position with his knees drawn up, similar to the human astronauts that would eventually follow in his footsteps.||He endured takeoff, 9 minutes of microgravity, and atmospheric entry without any health problems, but was lost at sea after the navy was unable to recover his capsule, which had either suffered a parachute or floatation failure.",1,monkey,,,,,
Miss Able,USA,Bioflight 2 (Jupiter AM-18),28 May 1959,Rhesus Macaque,"This second flight of monkeys aboard a Jupiter IRBM (Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile).  The rocket carried two passengers:  a rhesus macaque named Miss Able and a squirrel monkey named Miss Baker.  Their flight was successful, reaching an apogee of 580 km and successfully re-entering the atmosphere without a recovery failure.  Unfortunately, Miss Able died four days the mission during surgery to remove an implanted electrode.  Miss Baker survived, becoming the first monkey to return to Earth from space without issue.","Miss Able, a rhesus macaque, was born at a pet store in Independence, Missouri.  She replaced a trained rhesus macaque that was born in India, whom President Eisenhower removed from the mission for fear that it might offend the Indian people.  Similar to Gordo's flight, she was fitted with a miniature spacesuit and helmet and restrained to a miniature couch.  She flew alongside a much smaller squirrel monkey named MIss Baker.||Miss Able was trained to depress a telegraph key with her right hand whenever she saw a red light in her capsule blink to test her awareness throughout the mission.  Whie the rocket flight was nominal and she suffered no health concerns throughout it, she was unable to complete the blinking light task.  The air force stated this was due to a transmission failure that prevented the light from operating, but it was rumored that she was simply wasn't trained well enough to avoid distractions and execute her task.||After passing her post-flight physical with no issues, she was brought to the Armored Medical Research Laboratory at Fort Knox for a surgery to remove an implanted electrode in her head to prevent a possible infection.  Unfortunately the trichloroethylne anesthesia caused a cardiac arrhythmia and she died despite doctors working for two hours to resuscitate her.  The doctors determined that the spaceflight wasn't a contributing factor and that she, for whatever reason, was just inherently sensitive to the anesthesia.  Miss Baker fortunately survived with no complications.||Miss Able's body was taxidermied and is on display at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C.",1,monkey,,,,,
Goliath,USA,Atlas 32E,10 November 1961,Squirrel Monkey,"This US Air Force mission was intended to fly a squirrel monkey named Goliath to an apogee of 1,050 km aboard an Atlas rocket, but the rocket's main sustainer engine failed 15 seconds into flight, sending it on a dangerous trajectory.  The range safety officer triggered the flight termination system, destroying the rocket in the air before it could impact the ground (which would cause its onboard fuel to explode) and kill more people.","Goliath was given his name as a joke given his small size (only weighing 1.5 pounds).  His flight aboard an Atlas rocket was intended to fly through the lower Van Allen radiation belt (which extends from roughly 1,000 to 12,000 km in altitude).  The mission would reveal if a brief exposure to the belt would have any negative health effects.  Goliath was much less restrained than monkeys in previous flight tests as part of Project SPURT (Small Primate Unrestrained Test).  The flight also included fruit flies, a common model organism, and other insect eggs.||Goliath and the insects died when the rocket veered off course due to an engine failure and was detonated by the range safety officer before it could impact the ground and cost even more lives.",1,monkey,,,,,
Scatback,USA,Atlas 6F,20 December 1961,Rhesus Macaque,"This F-series Atlas flight was intended to gain further information about the health effects of microgravity and in-flight acceleration, with the mission having a special emphasis on atmospheric re-entry dynamics.  The flight reached an apogee of 970 km, and its passenger, a rhesus macaque named Scatback, survived re-entry but was lost at sea.","Scatback the rhesus macaque was named after the offensive position in American Football (a small, nimble player meant to outmaneuver the defense).  The reason why Scatback was named this is apparently lost to time.  To make the monkey's survival more likely after the failure to recover Goliath, Scatback's capsule was mounted on the booster's side for what was intended to be a more robust release.||Scatback survived the flight, including its rough atmospheric re-entry, and the parachute deployed for a successful splashdown.  Unfortunately, the capsule's radio transmitter failed limiting recovery crews to a difficult visual search over a wide area, which whitecap waves made even harder.  Scatback was eventually declared lost at sea.",1,monkey,,,,,
Bonnie,USA,Biosatellite 3,8 July 1969,Pig-tailed Macaque,"Biosatellite 3 carried Bonnie, a pig-tailed macaque, and launched aboard a Delta rocket.  It was intended to orbit Earth for 30 days to see the effects of prolonged microgravity and cosmic ray exposure on primate physiology.  Bonnie's health rapidly declined in-orbit, so the mission was ended after 8 days.  He died shortly after recovery.","Bonnie, a pig-tailed macaque, was chosen to fly aboard Biosatellite 3 and orbit Earth for 30 days.  Up to this point, the longest orbital spaceflight was achieved by the crew of Gemini VII in 1965, who flew for 13 days.  It was hoped that monitoring Bonnie would reveal the effects of prolonged microgravity and cosmic ray exposure.  33 data channels were recorded in flight, including electrolyte balance, brain activity, and cardiovascular activity.  To do this, Bonnie had numerous electrodes and catheters implanted in him before flight.  The research team also amputated his tail, pulled out his incisor teeth, and sutured his anus.||Bonnie stopped eating and drinking after 5 days in orbit.  Bonnie's heartrate and body temperature fell so dangerously low that he was brought back to earth 3 days later, after spending only 8 days total in space.||8 hours after his capsule was recovered, Bonnie died with doctors unable to resuscitate him.  He had lost over a quarter of his bodyweight during his week in space and was extremely dehydrated.  Initially, researchers thought he somehow died due to complications from microgravity exposure, but the cause of death was ultimately ruled as 'over-instrumentation'.",1,monkey,,,,,

The Veronique AGI was an upgraded version of earlier rockets in the Veronique sounding rocket family.  After AGI24 launched from Launch Complex Blandine, the motor burn was shorter and less powerful than expected, resulting in the rocket having an apogee of only 111 km.  The rocket's occupant, a Wistar rat named Hector, was successfully recovered after his capsule parachuted to the ground.  He was killed six months later for dissection.","As with other early biological spaceflight missions, Hector's mission was intended to reveal the effects of microgravity on a model organism (in this case, a Wistar rat).  The program was conducted by the Centre d'Enseignement et de Recherches de Medecine Aeronatique (CERMA) under Robert Grandpierre.  ||The researchers first tried using frogs but switched to rats which they found easier to attach electrodes to.  Hector and the other candidate rats had electrodes surgically attached to their skulls in order to measure brain activity.  Other electrodes measured the activity of the diaphragm and neck muscles, heartrate, respiratory rate, and body temperature.To train the rats for weightlessness, they were hung by their tails for increasing periods.  They were also placed in centrifuges to acclimatize them to the strong acceleration of a rocket flight.||Hector was chosen after AGI24's first intended passenger chewed through some of the electrode wires in their capsule.

They were first trained to stay in a capsule for increasing periods of time, starting with 1 hour, until they would obediently remain in the capsule for several days.  They were then exposed to up to 10 g's of acceleration in centrifuges, exposed to brief bouts of simulated microgravity in parabolic airplane flights, held on vibration tables, and placed in pressure chambers to acclimatize them to changing pressure.||Along with a dog named Tsygan, Physician Vladimir Yazdovsky chose Dezik for the first biological test flight of the R-1 rocket (and the Soviet Union's first ever attempt at an animal spaceflight) because of their 'calmness and endurance'.

Lisichka and Chayka,USSR,Sputnik 5-1 (Vostok 1K launch),28 July 1960,Dog,"This flight, intended to be the fifth Sputnik mission was the first flight of the Vostok 1K rocket (a derivative of the R-7 ICBM) and featured the first Vostok orbital spacecraft with a recovery system, which held dogs Pcholka and Mushka.  19 seconds after launch, a side booster broke away from the first stage and the rocket fell to the ground and exploded.","Dogs Lisichka (Russian: Лисичка, meaning 'little fox') and Chayka (Russian: Чайка, meaning 'seagull') were intended to be the first beings to return from Earth orbit as part of the Vostok program (which on 12 April 1961 resulted in Yuri Gagarin becoming both the first human in space and to orbit Earth).  The dogs' mission was the second test of the Vostok spacecraft (the first featuring a recovery system).||Engineer Boris Evseevich Chertok recalls seeing Sergei Korolev, the head of the Soviet space program, with the dogs immediately before launch.  Chertok said 'The affectionate red-haired Lisichka was very much liked by Korolev.  In the MIK (assembly and test complex), the medics were preparing to fit her into the ejection capsule of the descent vehicle.  With engineer Shevelev, we were sorting out another issue regarding the connection of electrical circuits to the dog container of the catapult and descent vehicle.  Lisichka was completely unresponsive to our arguments and the general test commotion.  Korolev approached.  I was about to report, but he waved it off, and without asking the medics, took Lisichka in his arms.  She trustingly nestled against him.  Korolev carefully stroked the dog and, not embarrassed by those around, said 'I really want you to come back.'  Korolev's face was unusually sad.  He held her for a few more seconds, then handed her to someone in a white coat and, without looking back, slowly wandered into the noisy hall of the MIK.'  Other contemporaries agreed that Lisichka was Korolev's favorite of the space dogs.||18 seconds into the flight, a side booster broke away from the rocket's first stage.  With insufficient thrust to continue upward, the rocket fell to the ground and exploded at 38 seconds after launch.  To prevent a repeat of this disaster, Soviet engineers developed a launch escape system that would carry the crew capsule away from a doomed rocket.  The resulting system would go on to save four human  and two dog astronauts.  When the third stage of the rocket carrying Vasily Lazarev and Oleg Makarov for the Soyuz-18-1 mission failed, they were carried to safety, as were dogs Kometa and Shutka during the Soyuz-7-1 mission which suffered a similar problem.  Vladimir Titov and Gennady Strekalov were saved when their rocket for the Soyuz T-10-1 mission exploded immediately at launch.",2,dog,,,,,

At the beginning of procedures for atmospheric re-entry, the spacecraft's stabilization system malfunctioned and the deorbit burn was shorter than intended.  This resulted in a trajectory that would land the craft in China instead of the USSR.||The spacecraft had an automatic self-destruct system programmed to detonate if it was heading toward foreign territory.  It was deemed more valuable to prevent the spacecraft's design from being revealed to foreigners than to save the lives of the animal astronauts aboard.  As programmed, the spacecraft self-destructed, killing Pcholka, Mushka, and the guinea pigs, mice, and rats that had ridden along with them.||Pcholka and Muska were the final space dogs to die for the Soviet space program and, along with Laika, were the only dogs to be killed intentionally.",2,dog,,,,,

Pierre and Tee-Nom,USA,Orbiting Frog Otolith,15 November 1970,American bullfrog,"The Orbiting Frog Otolith spacecraft launched atop a Scout B rocket from Launch Area 3 at Wallops Flight Facility on 9 November 1970.  The spacecraft held two American bullfrogs (named Pierre and Tee-Nom) for an experiment to evaluate how the otolith, an inner ear structure that enables perception of acceleration, acclimates to microgravity.  The experiment was successful at collecting the desired data, but both frogs died when the onboard battery failed.  Nonetheless, the spacecraft had no recovery system, so Pierre and Tee-Nom were doomed regardless.","Pierre and Tee-Nom (Louisiana French for 'Little Name') were two American bullfrogs purchased from the Louisiana Frog Company and downselected from a group of 20 candidate.  The Orbiting Frog Otolith sought to understand how the microgravity affects the otolith, am inner ear structure made of calcium carbonate that permits the preception of acceleration in vertebrates.  Bullfrogs were chosen for the experiemtn because of how similar their inner ear is to a human's.||Each frog had electrodes implanted in their thoracic cavity and vestibular nerves.  To stop the frogs from moving and dislodging the electrodes, researchers severed the nerves of their arms and legs, rendering them quadriplegic.||The frogs were held within a water-filled centrifuge in the spacecraft that periodically rotated their them to gauge their vestibular response.  The water helped cushion the frogs from the acceleration of the rocket launch and let them breathe through their skin.||Pierre and Tee-Nom died on their seventh day in orbit when the onboard battery failed.  A recovery system wasn't included in the spacecraft, meaning the frogs were always expected to die.||The included photograph shows a researcher implanting electrodes in a bullfrog in preparation for the OFO experiment that may or may not be one of the animals that flew to space.",2,amphibian,,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbiting_Frog_Otolith,,,
